# Inverse Kinematics on Arduino: 6 DoF Robotic Arm

This project demonstrates inverse kinematics control of a 6 degrees-of-freedom (6 DoF) robotic arm using an Arduino Uno, MG996R servo motors, and a PCA9685 PWM driver. The arm receives 3D Cartesian coordinates via serial commands and translates them into joint angles using basic IK calculations.
